        Habyarimana Iddy, born in 1998 in Rusizi, Western Province, Rwanda, is
        a <br />
        professional artist who lives and works in Rwanda. From a young age,{" "}
        <br />
        Habyarimana dreamed of becoming an architect, but by the age of 15 he
        found <br />
        himself drawn to the world of fine art. Influenced by his teachers and
        classmates <br />
        who recognized his talent for Capturing Images From Student Books, he
        chose to <br />
        pursue art in secondary school, eventually enrolling at École d&apos;Art de
        Nyundo. <br />
    </p>
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-[800px] leading-10 align-middle">
        In 2016, Habyarimana put his first brush to canvas, embarking on a
        journey that <br />
        would solidify his love for portraiture and figurative abstraction.
        His work often <br />
        focuses on the lives and experiences of Black People capturing moments
        of <br />
        humanity with a focus on the unique aspects of individual faces. He
        has long been <br />
        fascinated by how we share common physical features yet remain
        visually distinct <br />
        from one another. This curiosity has driven him to study and portray
        these <br />
        differences in his artwork. <br />
    </p>
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-[800px] leading-10 align-middle">
        Primarily working with oil paints and acrylics, Habyarimana&apos;s
        portraits lean toward <br />
        realism. His technique often involves the application of both thick
        and thin layers <br />
        of paint, which lends depth and texture to his works. Through his art,
        he explores <br />
        the complexities of identity and human connection. <br />
    </p>
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-[800px] leading-10 align-middle">
        Habyarimana believes that &apos;art is life, and painting is oxygen.&apos; To
        him, art is a vital <br />
        force that brings joy, freedom, and an ongoing opportunity to learn.
        It allows him <br />
        to connect with people and express the deeper meanings behind their
        visual <br />
        language, sharing those experiences with the world.
